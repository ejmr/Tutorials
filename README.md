My Tutorials for Programming and Sofhware
=========================================

## ABOUT

This repository contains my personal tutorials for teaching computer progamming
and how to use certain types of software, i.e. programming tools.  Right now
the repository has nothing to read---sorry!---but I am currently writing
tutorials.  I hope you look forward to it!

If you have any suggestions for content---for example you want me to wrte
about GNU Emacs Lisp, using the Meta Object Protocol, improving Python code
with type hints to help create command-line applications---open an issue on
the (official GitHub page)[https://github.com/ejmr/passing-on-my-knowledege].
I will try to write about any coding topic I know.
